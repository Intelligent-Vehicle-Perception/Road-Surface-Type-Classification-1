# Road Surface Type Classification Based on Inertial Sensors and Machine Learning

This project contains the Artificial Intelligence models and experiments developed for the paper [Road Surface Type Classification Based on Inertial Sensors and Machine Learning](). In this research, we developed models for the road surface classification, classifying between segments of dirt, cobblestone and alphalt roads. We applied classical techniques of K-Means Clustering (KMC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); and Deep Learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and hybrid LSTM-CNN. The contents of each folder are described below.

## Notebooks

The jupyter notebooks present in the folders correspond to the applied techniques. To run the models, just change the folders where the datasets are located (*datasets_folder*) and the work folder that has the experiments (*work_folder*).  These parameters are in the files **Classical Methods - Processing.ipynb** and **Deep Learning - Processing.ipynb files**. Other instructions are documented in source code.

## Experiments

This folder contains all the experiments performed. Each folder stores the experiments of a technique, among the generated models and execution logs.
